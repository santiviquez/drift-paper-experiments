# drift-paper-experiments

This repository contains my experiments using data and models from the paper ["Open-Source Drift Detection Tools in Action: Insights from Two Use Cases"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18673).

I wrote this blog post: [There's data drift, but does it matter](https://www.nannyml.com/blog/data-drift-does-it-matter) to share my thoughts on why I believe some of the experiments in the paper could have been done better.
