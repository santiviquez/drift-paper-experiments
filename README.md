# drift-paper-experiments

This repository contains my experiments using data and models from the paper ["Open-Source Drift Detection Tools in Action: Insights from Two Use Cases"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18673).

I created it to share my thoughts on why I believe some of the experiments in the paper could have been done better. The blog hasn’t been published yet but will be live in a week at nannyml.com/blog.

(I’ll update this readme once the blog is public.)
